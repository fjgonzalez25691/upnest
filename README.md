# UpNest - AWS Lambda Hackathon 2025

> **Professional baby growth tracking with enterprise-grade AWS architecture.** Secure, scalable, and production-ready healthcare application for infant development monitoring.

---

## Personal Story & Motivation

This project was built by a **59-year-old first-time father with ADHD** who wanted to prove that it's never too late to learn new technologies. 

As someone who chose parenthood later in life, I realized how difficult it is to monitor a baby's growth and understand what percentiles really mean. I created UpNest to make this process easier for parents of all ages and neurotypes‚Äîespecially mature adults and people with ADHD like me.

**This was my first time working with AWS serverless tools.** Despite the challenges of learning Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway from scratch while managing ADHD, I wanted to show that being neurodivergent or older doesn't exclude anyone from the world of technology.

UpNest is proof that with determination, anyone can build enterprise-grade applications. I hope this project inspires other mature adults and neurodivergent developers to keep learning and building.
