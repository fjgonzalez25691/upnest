## About the Project: UpNest

### Inspiration

I am a 59-year-old father—someone who chose parenthood later in life, at an age when many people distance themselves from technology. I also have ADHD, which means I face daily challenges with focus and organization. Despite this, I wanted to prove that it's never too late to learn new skills or embrace new technologies.

As a first-time father, I realized how hard it is to monitor a baby's growth and truly understand what percentiles mean. I created UpNest to make this process easier for parents of all ages and neurotypes—especially mature adults and people with ADHD like me. My goal is to empower families with simple, reliable tools, using modern technology to bring peace of mind.

### What I Learned

This was my first time working with AWS serverless tools. I learned how to:
- Build and deploy AWS Lambda functions for backend logic.
- Connect and store user data securely in DynamoDB.
- Use API Gateway to integrate the frontend and backend.
- Experiment with Amazon Bedrock to provide AI-powered health guidance.

### How I Built It

- **Frontend:** Developed with React, so parents can input and visualize their baby's growth data.
- **Backend:** All logic runs on AWS Lambda, managing data between the frontend and DynamoDB.
- **Database:** DynamoDB efficiently stores and retrieves growth records.
- **AI Integration:** Amazon Bedrock powers a conversational assistant for parents' health and growth questions.

### Challenges

- Learning AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB from scratch at nearly 60 was a real challenge.
- Managing ADHD during intense learning and building sessions.
- Creating an interface that's easy for all parents to use and trust.
- Integrating AI safely and meaningfully.
- Balancing limited daily hours with a tight deadline.

Despite these hurdles, I am proud to present UpNest as proof that it is never too late to learn, and that being neurodivergent or older does not exclude anyone from the world of technology. I hope this project inspires mature adults and others with ADHD to keep learning and building.
