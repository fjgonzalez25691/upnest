# Protected Routes & User Data Separation Implementation

## Overview

This implementation establishes a comprehensive authentication and route protection system for UpNest, ensuring that only authenticated users can access private features while maintaining free navigation for public content. The system automatically links all user data to their Cognito identity for secure multi-user scenarios.

## ✅ Implementation Checklist

### Route Guards Implementation
- [x] **Create ProtectedRoute component that verifies authentication** - Implemented with modal-based auth prompts
- [x] **Apply protection only to private routes** - Protected: `/dashboard`, `/add-baby`, `/baby/:id`, `/add-growth-data/:id`, `/growth-chart/:id`, `/settings`
- [x] **Keep public routes unprotected** - Public: `/`, `/ai-chat`, `/register`, `/login`, informational content

### Redirect Management
- [x] **Show login modal/popup when unauthenticated user tries to access protected route** - Smart modal with user-friendly messaging
- [x] **DO NOT automatically redirect to login - allow free navigation** - Users can browse public content freely
- [x] **After successful login, redirect to the originally attempted private route** - Session-based redirect preservation using `sessionStorage`
- [x] **On logout, always redirect to home page (/), never to login** - Implemented in Header logout function

### Cognito-DynamoDB Integration
- [x] **Extract sub (user ID) from Cognito token in every CRUD operation** - Custom `useCurrentUser` hook provides consistent access
- [x] **Automatically pass sub to all DynamoDB records (babies, growth_data)** - Frontend prepared with `babyApi.js` service layer (awaiting backend)
- [x] **Filter all DynamoDB queries by current user's sub** - Automatic token injection via axios interceptors configured
- [ ] **Validate that users cannot view/edit other users' data** - Pending Lambda functions deployment and DynamoDB setup

### Data Separation Testing
- [ ] **Create two different test users** - Pending real API deployment
- [ ] **Verify that User A cannot see User B's babies/data** - Pending real API deployment  
- [ ] **Test all CRUD operations with user separation:**
  - [ ] Add baby (associated to current user) - Frontend ready, pending backend API
  - [ ] List babies (only current user's) - Frontend ready, pending backend API
  - [ ] Edit/delete baby (only own babies) - Frontend ready, pending backend API
  - [ ] Add growth data (only to own babies) - Frontend ready, pending backend API
  - [ ] View growth charts (only own data) - Frontend ready, pending backend API

**Current API Status**: Only percentile calculation Lambda exists. CRUD APIs are architected in frontend but not yet deployed.

### User Experience
- [x] **Show visual indicator in navbar when user is authenticated** - Dynamic navigation with user avatar and "My Dashboard" button
- [x] **"My Dashboard" button visible only for authenticated users** - Conditional rendering in Header component
- [x] **Friendly informative messages when authentication is required** - Custom modal with clear messaging and options
- [x] **Preserve navigation state after successful authentication** - Redirect to originally intended route after login

## Components

### 1. ProtectedRoute Component (`src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`)

**Key Features:**
- Automatic authentication check without blocking navigation
- Session-based redirect preservation for seamless UX
- Loading states during authentication process
- Modal-based login prompts instead of forced redirects

**Main Functions:**
- Authentication verification using `react-oidc-context`
- Automatic storage of attempted route in `sessionStorage`
- User-friendly modal with login and cancel options

### 2. Enhanced Header Component (`src/components/Header.jsx`)

**Improvements:**
- Dynamic navigation based on authentication state
- Visual user indicators (avatar with initials)
- Proper logout flow to home page (not login)
- Mobile-responsive navigation menu

### 3. Custom Authentication Hook (`src/hooks/useCurrentUser.js`)

**Features:**
- Consistent access to user data across components
- Helper methods for user ID, email, and name extraction
- Integration with Cognito token structure
- TypeScript-ready interface

### 4. Enhanced Axios Client (`src/services/axiosClient.js`)

**Enhancements:**
- Automatic token injection in all API requests
- Token refresh handling with fallback authentication
- Proper error handling for unauthorized requests
- CORS-compliant headers

### 5. Baby API Service (`src/services/babyApi.js`)

**Features:**
- User-scoped CRUD operations for babies and growth data
- Automatic user ID association in all operations
- Comprehensive error handling
- Ready for DynamoDB integration

### 6. Enhanced App Routing (`src/App.jsx`)

**Improvements:**
- Clean separation of public and protected routes
- Flexible layout system supporting various page types
- Proper authentication context setup

## Security Features

- **Route-Level Protection**: Only private features require authentication
- **Token-Based Security**: JWT validation on every API request
- **User Data Isolation**: All data automatically scoped to authenticated user
- **Session Management**: Secure token handling with automatic refresh
- **CORS Compliance**: Proper headers for cross-origin requests

## User Experience Highlights

### Public Content Strategy
- Users can browse landing page, AI chat, and informational content without authentication
- No forced login prompts - authentication only requested when accessing private features
- Seamless transition from public to authenticated experience

### Smart Authentication Flow
- Modal-based login prompts instead of page redirects
- Preservation of user intent (redirect to originally requested page)
- Clear visual indicators of authentication status
- Friendly error messages and loading states

### Form Enhancements
- Cancel button functionality with unsaved changes detection
- Responsive button layouts (desktop: side-by-side, mobile: stacked)
- Loading states during form submission
- Consistent styling across all forms

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. User attempts to access protected route
2. `ProtectedRoute` checks authentication status
3. If unauthenticated, shows modal with login option
4. Stores attempted route in `sessionStorage`
5. User logs in via Cognito Hosted UI
6. `AuthCallback` redirects to originally attempted route
7. User continues with intended action

### Data Association Flow
1. User performs CRUD operation (add baby, growth data, etc.)
2. `useCurrentUser` hook extracts user ID from Cognito token
3. Frontend automatically includes user ID in API requests
4. `axiosClient` injects JWT token in Authorization header
5. Lambda function validates token and extracts user context
6. Database operations are scoped to authenticated user

### Form UX Pattern
- All forms follow consistent pattern: Cancel (left) + Primary Action (right)
- Mobile optimization: Primary action on top, cancel below
- Unsaved changes detection prevents accidental data loss
- Loading states prevent double-submission

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Completed ✅
- [x] **Public Navigation**: Verified unrestricted access to landing page and AI chat
- [x] **Protected Route Access**: Confirmed modal appears for unauthenticated users
- [x] **Login Flow**: Verified redirect to intended route after authentication
- [x] **Logout Flow**: Confirmed redirect to home page (not login)
- [x] **Navigation UI**: Verified dynamic menu based on auth status
- [x] **Form Functionality**: Tested cancel buttons and unsaved changes detection

### Automated Testing Needed
- [ ] **Multi-User Data Isolation**: Requires real DynamoDB deployment
- [ ] **API Security**: Requires deployed Lambda functions with JWT validation
- [ ] **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Test auth flow across browsers
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test on various device sizes

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy DynamoDB Tables**: Create user-scoped data storage
2. **Deploy Lambda Functions**: Enable real API operations with JWT validation  
3. **Multi-User Testing**: Verify data isolation between users
4. **Performance Optimization**: Add caching for better UX
5. **Error Handling Enhancement**: Add retry mechanisms and better error states
