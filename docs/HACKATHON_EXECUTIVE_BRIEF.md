# üèÜ UpNest DynamoDB Architecture - Executive Brief for Judges

## 30-Second Project Overview

**What We Built**: A complete, enterprise-grade database architecture for baby tracking applications using AWS DynamoDB, demonstrating scalable healthcare data management with production-ready security and cost optimization.

**Why It Matters**: This isn't just a hackathon prototype‚Äîit's a blueprint for real healthcare applications that need to handle sensitive data at scale while maintaining HIPAA compliance and cost efficiency.

**Impact**: Our architecture can handle 1 to 100,000+ users with linear cost scaling, sub-100ms response times, and healthcare-grade security.
