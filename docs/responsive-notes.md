| Register  | Centered form, fields stacked vertically, large button, small margins, ~90% width | Centered form, fields stacked, fixed width (e.g., 400px), more side space, possible card or shadow |
| Login     | Same as register: stacked fields, large button, simplified navigation         | Same as register: centered form, fixed width, optional side panel with image or branding |

**Common details:**
- On mobile, the form takes almost the full width, with minimal padding/margins.
- On desktop, the form is centered with a limited width, sometimes with decorative elements or side panels.
- Typography and buttons are sized for easy tapping on mobile.
